Quickstart Guide
============

A test example (SN 2010bc, a Type Ia supernova) is included in the package. After installing extrabol, you should be able to run:

.. code-block:: bash

    extrabol ./example/PSc000174_extrabol.dat --verbose -m 1a


This example may take a minute the first time you run it as astroquery fetches filter information!
